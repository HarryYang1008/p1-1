 Part(1):
	for part 1, I import the socket for build the server.
	how to run the programe:
		1.download or copy the code file and html file to the local in the same folder\n
		2.I used Chrome browerser for the test. So open the Chrome browser
  		3.run the cmd and type in 'ipconfig' to check your IP(IPv4) address
  		4.open the floder that contain both server.py and helloword.html in VSCode
  		5.run the server.py in VSC terminal, you will see:
    			the web server is on prot: 80
    			Ready to serve...
		6.In Chrome,type in the Url in form: http://172.25.51.22:80/helloword.html and load the page
   		  (you should replace'172.25.51.22' with your own IP address)
   		  then you will see the 'Hello world' on the loaded page an get the feed back 
  		7.then change the url to 'http://172.25.51.22:80/hello.html' and load the page
   		  you will see the 404 error both in terminal and web page
